# OpenRL_Baker
A semi-finished lightmap baker based on OpenRL.

This project is one of our company's project, but we won't maintain it any more, cause of we turned to do other things and for me, I think using Vulkan with RTX instead of OpenRL is a good choice because I can use one API both for baking and previewing. But, apart from this point, there are a lot of problems to slove when writting this project, I hope any one can slove them better than me. The license of this project is MIT, and it shares a lot of 3rd party existing. I have not make it clean and it is build by VS2015 now, instead of a project generated by CMAKE.
